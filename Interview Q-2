Practice Azure Devops CICD build pipeline

Explain complete azure CICD build pipeline?

How to reduce the time of build in azure devops pipeline?? How to optimize the cicd pipeline for faster build ?

> By using pipeline templates so that it will be easier to pass build parameters
> By using task group in azure so that we don’t have to write same set of tasks multiple times and pipeline will run faster
> by using incremental build in azure, we can ramp up the build process so that everytime pipeline runs, it wont start from scratch.
> Pipeline caching can help reduce build time by allowing the outputs or downloaded dependencies from one run to be reused in later runs, thereby reducing or avoiding the cost to recreate or redownload the same files again.

What is pipeline caching in Azure Devops?
>Pipeline caching can help reduce build time by allowing the outputs or downloaded dependencies from one run to be reused in later runs, thereby reducing or avoiding the cost to recreate or redownload the same files again. Caching is especially useful in scenarios where the same dependencies are downloaded over and over at the start of each run.

By using the Cache@2 task we can specify the packages that we want to cache for the next build run.

How to install Sonarqube in vm?? What is the architecture of sonarqube ?

> 

the SonarQube Platform is made of 4 components: 
1.	SonarQube Server starting 3 main processes: 
Web Server for developers,
Search Server based on Elasticsearch
Compute Engine Server in charge of processing code analysis reports
2.	SonarQube Database to store:
the configuration of the SonarQube instance (security, plugins settings, etc.)
the quality snapshots of projects, views, etc
3.	Multiple SonarQube Plugins installed on the server, possibly including language, SCM, integration, authentication, and governance plugins
4.	SonarScanners running on your Build / Continuous Integration Servers to analyze project

What are application security groups in azure??
>Application security groups enable you to configure network security as a natural extension of an application's structure, allowing you to group virtual machines and define network security policies based on those groups

To which resources can you attach a NSG in azure?
>NSGs can be associated with subnets or individual virtual machine instances within that subnet. When an NSG is associated with a subnet, the ACL rules apply to all Virtual Machine instances of that subnet.

What is azure ddos protection?


Have you used WAF or Web Application Firewall?
>Azure WAF is a web application firewall that helps protect your web applications from common threats such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and other web exploits. You can define a WAF policy consisting of a combination of custom and managed rules to control access to your web applications.


What are azure web service rules?
>Web Role is a Cloud Service role in Azure that is configured and customized to run web applications developed on programming languages/technologies that are supported by Internet Information Services (IIS), such as ASP.NET, PHP

Worker Role is any role in Azure that runs applications and services level tasks, which generally do not require IIS. In Worker Roles, IIS is not installed by default. They are mainly used to perform supporting background processes along with Web Roles and do tasks such as automatically compressing uploaded images, run scripts when something changes in the database, get new messages from queue and process and more.

The main difference between the two is that:
●	a Web Role automatically deploys and hosts your app through IIS
●	a Worker Role does not use IIS and runs your app standalone

Practice terraform code

How to pass a variable value using terraform command in the command line?
> terraform apply -var=”var_name=var_value”

What are the conditions in terraform?
> condition ? true_val : false_val
If condition is true then result is true_val, else result is false_val


What are meta arguments in terraform?
> Meta-arguments come in handy in situations like creating resources in the same cloud provider, but in different regions, or when creating multiple identical resources with different names, or when we have to declare implicit dependencies in places where Terraform is not able to identify the dependency itself.
Different types of meta-arguments
●	depends_on
●	count
●	for_each
●	provider
●	Lifecycle
●	Resource Provider
depends_on meta-argument to explicitly define the dependency.
count requires a whole number and will then create that resource that number of times.
for_each meta argument accepts a map or set of strings. Terraform will create one instance of that resource for each member of that map or set
provider meta-argument specifies which provider to be used for a resource.
The lifecycle meta-argument defines the lifecycle for the resource. 
	Three types:
	Create_before_destroy
	Prevent_destroy
	ignore_changes

What is the lifecycle in terraform?
>The lifecycle meta-argument defines the lifecycle for the resource. 
	4 types:
	Create_before_destroy
	Prevent_destroy
	Ignore_changes
replace_triggered_by
	
Create_before_destroy : The create_before_destroy meta-argument changes this behavior so that the new replacement object is created first, and the prior object is destroyed after the replacement is created.

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  # ...

  lifecycle {
    create_before_destroy = true
  }
}




Prevent_destroy : This meta-argument, when set to true, will cause Terraform to reject with an error any plan that would destroy the infrastructure object associated with the resource, as long as the argument remains present in the configuration.


Ignore_changes : The ignore_changes feature is intended to be used when a resource is created with references to data that may change in the future, but should not affect said resource after its creation.

Replace_triggered_by : Replaces the resource when any of the referenced items change. Supply a list of expressions referencing managed resources, instances, or instance attributes. When used in a resource that uses count or for_each, you can use count.index or each.key in the expression to reference specific instances of other resources that are configured with the same count or collection.


What are terraform provisioners ?
> File provisioners> copy files from local host to remote resource

What are liveness and readiness probes in kubernetes?

How do you define liveness and readiness probes inside deployment?
>in k8s deployments, under spec> containers> use below code
The kubelet uses liveness probes to know when to restart a container.
The kubelet uses readiness probes to know when a container is ready to start accepting traffic. 
Liveness>>
   livenessProbe:
      exec:
        command:
        - cat
        - /tmp/healthy
      initialDelaySeconds: 5
      periodSeconds: 5
Readiness>>
readinessProbe:
  exec:
    command:
    - cat
    - /tmp/healthy
  initialDelaySeconds: 5
  periodSeconds: 5

Learn the basics of ansible ?



Features of Azure Application Gateway >>>

Being in layer 7 it has some features, like 
-	url redirection/routing
-	url rewriting/request rewriting
-	ssl/tls termination/offload
-	session affinity
-	connection draining

Load Balancer works on Layer 4 so it won't work on HTTPS. It only works on tcp and udp.

Basic load balancer can support 300 instances
Standard Load Balancer can support 1000 instances


Ansible is an agent less so less overhead and less management.
Ansibles have modules, they are the smallest unit of work. Any small tasks are carried out by modules,but you can run them in order / sequentially in ansible playbooks by putting relevant modules in a single file.
